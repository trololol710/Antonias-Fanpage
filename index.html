        So I was looking online, but there was none. <br />
        I figured someone needs to start coding to create one, because as you know, she really deserves a fan page.<br />
         I took the sacrifice, and here it is:   <br />
          <b>Antonia Leannes official fan page.</b>
        </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <hr size"3" noshade />
    <br />
    <p>
      Here is a link to her <a href="C:\Users\sgeis\Desktop\Web Development\HTML-Personal site\attributes.html">best attributes</a>, so you can know why she is so awesome that she deserves a website.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        She also has her own portfolio, which I think is proper amazing. Click <a href="https://antonialeanne.myportfolio.com/">here</a> to get there.
